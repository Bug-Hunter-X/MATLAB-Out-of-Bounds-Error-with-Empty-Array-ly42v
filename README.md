This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB error that can occur when accessing array elements. The error, which is a common case of out-of-bounds error, occurs when attempting to access an element at an index outside the bounds of an empty array. The `bug.m` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version that handles this case gracefully using conditional statements.
